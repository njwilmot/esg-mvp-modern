Mapping: Google Maps API, Mapbox, or Leaflet.js for an interactive map.
UI Framework: Tailwind CSS for modern, clean design.
Backend
Framework: Node.js with Express.js (or Django with Python) to handle APIs and logic.
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user data, city details, and reviews.
APIs:
Google Places API for neighborhood amenities and landmarks.
OpenWeatherMap API for climate and weather patterns.
Zillow API for housing data.
Crimeometer API for crime statistics.
AI/ML
Use machine learning for personalized recommendations:
TensorFlow or PyTorch to analyze user preferences.
Predict the best neighborhoods or services based on patterns in data.
Hosting and Infrastructure
Cloud Platform: AWS (Amazon Web Services) or Google Cloud for scalability.
Storage: S3 for image and document uploads (e.g., receipts, utility bills).
Authentication: Firebase Auth or Auth0 for secure logins.
Step 3: Development Steps
1. Set Up the Interactive Map
Tools: Google Maps API or Mapbox.

Create a database of average costs for major cities (groceries, transportation, rent, etc.).
Use a REST API to query and calculate comparisons.
Frontend:
Sliders for user preferences.
Real-time updates to display costs.
3. Add Neighborhood Insights
Data Sources:
Rent prices from Zillow or Rentometer.
Crime data from Crimeometer or local government sources.
Walkability scores from Walk Score API.
Implementation:
Create cards for each neighborhood with summarized data.
Include icons for amenities (e.g., parks, schools).
4. Implement Moving Checklist
Frontend:
Dynamic UI where users can add/edit/delete tasks.
Pre-filled tasks based on timeline and preferences.
Backend:
Store checklist data per user in the database.
5. Integrate Local Services
Data Integration:
Partner with service providers like U-Haul, TaskRabbit, or local movers.
Pull data via APIs or manually curate the database.
Frontend:
Display services as a searchable list with filters and reviews.
6. Build Community Forums
Frontend:
Allow users to post questions and respond.
Add upvotes and categories (e.g., “Schools,” “Commuting”).
Backend:
Store posts, comments, and votes in a database.
Implement real-time updates with WebSockets or Firebase.
Step 4: UI/UX Design
Use a clean, modern design with a focus on usability.

A search bar to input the target city.
Featured cities or trending neighborhoods.
Dashboard:
A map on the left and stats (cost of living, neighborhood insights) on the right.
Checklist Page:
A simple to-do list interface with progress tracking.
